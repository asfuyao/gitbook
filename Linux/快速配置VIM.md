# Linux, *nix, Mac OSX Installation

The easiest way to install [spf13-vim](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim) is to use our automatic installer by simply copying and pasting the following line into a terminal. This will install spf13-vim and backup your existing vim configuration. If you are upgrading from a prior version (before 3.0) this is also the recommended installation.

Requires Git 1.7+ and Vim 7.3+

```shell
curl https://j.mp/spf13-vim3 -L > spf13-vim.sh && sh spf13-vim.sh
```

If you have a bash-compatible shell you can run the script directly:

```shell
sh <(curl https://j.mp/spf13-vim3 -L)
```
